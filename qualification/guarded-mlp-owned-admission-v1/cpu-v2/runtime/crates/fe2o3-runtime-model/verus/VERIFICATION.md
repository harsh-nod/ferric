# Runtime model verification

This directory contains the issue #137 Verus specifications and the additive R7
asynchronous-resource, R8 execution-contract, R9 native-evidence, R10 closed
execution-composition, R11 runtime-semantics, R12 native-concurrency, R13
logical-scheduler, R14 async-observer, R16 Worker V5 semantic-boundary, R17
persistent-native-allocation, R18 persistent-local-SDMA-adapter, R19
directional-persistent-local-SDMA-adapter, R20 runtime-facade directional
chunking, R21 runtime scripted-failure-seam, and R22 batched directional
persistent-SDMA-window models. The authenticated runner proves 414 obligations
and rejects 228
expected-negative mutations over finite abstract values and traces. The
materialization input and image sequences are
capped at 64 MiB and its phase trace has exactly four entries. The
lifecycle-history sequence lengths are not bounded by these proofs.

`runtime_lifecycle_v1.rs` proves:

1. a retaining dispatch is bound to the exact VM, physical-device identity,
   and device generation carried by its referenced mapping; and
2. releasing a mapping preserves the runtime invariant when no prepared,
   published, or ambiguous dispatch retains that mapping.

`device_identity_generation_v1.rs` proves:

1. registering a fresh device generation preserves unique active generations;
2. registering a VM preserves its exact active device-generation binding;
3. an active VM cannot be substituted onto another generation of the same
   physical device; and
4. while a current generation is active, that generation or an older one
   cannot be reused as a fresh admission.

`device_projection_refinement_v1.rs` proves the pure boundary introduced for
the executable adapter:

1. the model projection retains every field represented in the formal
   canonical observation, including the literal V1 profile and UAPI-schema
   identities, initial wrapping VRAM-loss counter, and contracted reset-fence
   facts;
2. a canonical record satisfying the explicitly modeled V1 predicates projects
   to a model value satisfying the same exact profile/schema identities and
   contracted currentness facts;
3. the projection preserves the explicit 1-through-16-entry topology
   inventory, its pairwise physical/KFD/render/PCI identity uniqueness, and the
   unique selected-device match without replacing the inventory with an opaque
   hash;
4. appending a later generation preserves its exact predecessor link and the
   single-physical-device history invariant.

`memory_lifecycle_v1.rs` proves the initial R2 pure memory obligations:

1. a mapping retains the exact VM, physical-device generation, allocation ID,
   allocation generation, opaque-handle observation, and canonical bounded
   device set represented in the formal binding;
2. a failed map records exactly the reported successful device prefix;
3. a failed unmap treats `n_success` as an absolute cumulative prefix, assigns
   that value without adding prior progress, and retains the unreported suffix;
4. a failed unmap reporting the full prefix remains ambiguous and retains its
   prior conservative range;
5. a substituted device set produces no map state; and
6. any non-released mapping or live publication blocks allocation free.

`queue_lifecycle_v1.rs` proves the initial R4 compute-AQL queue obligations:

1. one concrete canonical four-resource plan exists, preventing the resource
   predicates from being accepted only vacuously;
2. ring, control, end-of-pipe, and context-save resources retain their exact
   composite VM, allocation ID, allocation generation, mapping ID, and
   publication identities and are pairwise distinct;
3. a successful create transition retains the exact plan, queue generation,
   resource sequence, configuration, and opaque returned queue ID, including
   queue ID zero;
4. CREATE status, unchanged/caller-labeled sentinel, returned `u32::MAX`, and
   known-ID collision conditions select Active versus fail-closed Ambiguous
   outcomes exactly; indeterminate CREATE retains a classified returned ID;
5. indeterminate update, disable, and destroy observations become Ambiguous only
   from their matching legal pending phases and retain the exact resources,
   configuration, and prior queue ID; CREATE is excluded from this generic
   relation and is covered only by the field/status-aware relation above;
6. CancelledBeforeCreate and Destroyed are exactly the two non-retaining
   terminals, reached by plan cancellation and successful destroy respectively;
7. direct destroy begins only from Active or Disabled, retains that exact source
   in the pending record, and a failed-no-effect observation restores the same
   source while success reaches Destroyed;
8. generic memory release cannot discharge a live publication structurally
   owned by an exact queue VM, instance, and generation;
9. every retaining queue blocks release of each exact composite mapping in its
   plan;
10. an ambiguous known queue ID remains reserved, while CreatePending or any
   number of Ambiguous states with no known ID poison process-level future
   CREATE; only CreatePending itself is globally single-flight; and
11. appending a history event preserves the exact prior sequence as a prefix
    and places the new event at the next index.

`load_plan_v1.rs` proves the initial R3 abstract load-plan relation:

1. every admitted segment retains the exact 4 KiB page-rounding equations,
   checked `u64` file, memory, and mapping ranges, containing mapping range,
   and the plan retains a checked image span no larger than 64 MiB;
2. the three segments are in canonical increasing virtual-address order, are
   pairwise disjoint in file, memory, and page-rounded mapping ranges, and have
   exactly one each of read-only, read-execute, and read-write permissions; and
3. an admitted descriptor has the same file-to-virtual-address delta within
   exactly one same-permission containing `PT_LOAD` segment.

`materialization_v1.rs` proves the next R3 abstract materialization operation:

1. the three canonical source and destination ranges use checked offset/end
   arithmetic, remain within the 64 MiB input and image bounds, and have
   pairwise-disjoint destinations;
2. the deterministic full-zero transition creates an image of the requested
   length with every byte equal to zero;
3. the deterministic copy-range transition writes the corresponding exact
   source byte at every destination index and preserves every byte outside the
   destination range;
4. for every canonical bounded three-segment plan and exact-length input, the
   defined zero/copy-first/copy-second/copy-third execution has all four states
   at the exact image length and its final byte at every index follows the
   corresponding deterministic transition;
5. the completed execution therefore places every byte from each of the three
   exact input source ranges at its checked destination;
6. every checked range disjoint from all three copy destinations remains zero;
   and
7. the modeled mapping prefixes, in-memory suffixes including BSS, modeled
   mapping tails, and inter-segment gaps satisfy that derived zero-preservation
   property; and
8. one concrete canonical three-segment plan is inhabited, and its constructed
   final image contains both a nonzero copied byte and an uncopied zero byte.

The materialization model receives already-formed mapping ranges. No theorem in
this file composes `MaterializationPlanV1` with
`load_plan_v1::canonical_load_plan_v1`, imports the separate load-plan
invariants, or proves that its mapping starts and sizes use 4096-byte rounding.
The 4 KiB and page-rounded properties listed above remain claims of the separate
`load_plan_v1.rs` proof only.

`aql_publication_v1.rs` proves the initial R4 abstract independent-header
packet-publication, single-producer reservation, and completion-signal
relations. Its release-word theorem is scoped to `0x1402`; it does not cover
the separately admitted wait-for-prior `0x1502` executable header:

1. copying one canonical 64-byte INVALID packet body into a checked bounded ring
   slot writes every exact source byte to the corresponding destination and
   preserves every ring byte outside that slot;
2. the modeled release-`u32` transition produces the exact little-endian
   system-scoped kernel-dispatch header, preserves both copied setup bytes, and
   preserves every byte outside the four-byte publication word;
3. composing those two transitions records an INVALID body before the final
   invariant header, retains the source setup dimension, and preserves the exact
   source and destination frame;
4. every accepted reservation advances the write counter exactly once, retains
   capacity, records the exact prior packet ID and modulo slot, and preserves the
   canonical bounded no-wrap state;
5. two accepted transitions linked through the exact intermediate state have
   distinct consecutive packet IDs and advance the initial write counter by two;
6. an accepted read observation is nondecreasing from the prior observation;
7. a full ring produces the exact Full rejection and no reservation;
8. every rejection branch returns the exact input state unchanged;
9. the pending completion-signal image is exactly 64 bytes, has little-endian
   USER kind one at byte zero and pending value one at byte eight, and has zero
   in every other byte;
10. classification of every supplied `i64` maps one to Pending, zero to
    Completed, and preserves every other value as Unexpected; and
11. concrete packet, ring, signal-image, classification, two-reservation, and
   full-ring witnesses inhabit the predicates, including a nonzero copied byte
   and a preserved byte outside the
   destination frame.

The AQL model operates only on mathematical byte sequences, integer and
natural-number counter states, and explicit successor relations. `release-u32`
names one abstract state transition; it is not evidence of a CPU atomic
operation, ordering, coherence, device visibility, or firmware consumption. No
theorem imports or refines `fe2o3-aql`, its byte encoder, initializer,
classifier, callback trait, or executable Rust ring model, native queue memory,
a doorbell, or an observed hardware read pointer.
The classifier's acquired-value name is only an input label; the proof performs
no load and establishes neither atomic object initialization nor CPU/GPU
visibility.

The two-step theorem proves linearity only along one supplied mathematical
successor chain. It does not establish uniqueness among independently
constructed Rust values, counter truth, completion, liveness, or performance.

`r7_async_resources_v1.rs` proves eight abstract asynchronous-resource,
memory-pool, and multi-device obligations:

1. leasing an eligible free block retains its exact pool, device, block, and
   generation coordinates and makes the block non-reusable;
2. submitting an exact leased block moves it to in-flight custody without
   changing its storage identity;
3. exact completion followed by release advances the lease generation and
   prevents the old lease from matching the free block;
4. a stale generation cannot submit a reused block;
5. two retained blocks in a valid roster cannot name the same storage;
6. an admitted peer copy retains its exact source and destination generations
   and executes on the destination device coordinate;
7. an incomplete dependency frontier leaves a reserved peer copy unpublished;
   and
8. quarantined storage is retained and never reusable.

These theorems do not refine `memory_pool.rs`, the KFD SDMA packet encoder,
queue counters, mapped atomics, the multi-device router, or any native call.
They do not prove that a hardware completion occurred or that a pool operation
is lock-free, wait-free, or performant.

`r8_execution_contracts_v1.rs` proves ten abstract scheduling, atomic, and
collective obligations:

1. reserving a copy leaves it unpublished and retains the destination epoch;
2. an incomplete dependency frontier prevents publication;
3. ready publication retains the exact operation, resource-generation, and
   destination-device binding;
4. two admitted overlapping operations have no read/write or write/write
   resource conflict;
5. a valid abstract atomic location has a supported 32- or 64-bit width and an
   offset aligned to that width;
6. an abstract aligned 32- or 64-bit fetch-add linearization retains its exact
   resource, generation, order, and scope, returns the old value, and records
   the mathematical sum as the new value;
7. a non-final, previously unseen collective member arrival remains in the
   gathering phase and cannot be published;
8. the final unique-member arrival makes the collective ready but does not
   publish it;
9. publishing a ready collective retains its device and epoch and requires the
   complete membership set; and
10. a duplicate member arrival does not advance the collective.

The R8 file models mathematical operations and values. It neither implements
wrapping device-integer arithmetic nor refines the executable runtime or KFD
adapter. In particular, its `destination_epoch` is a retained abstract field,
not a proof that executable submission performed no memory access. Its
copy type models whole, distinct resources without byte ranges or a physical
alias relation. Same-resource ranged copies accepted by an executable backend
are outside its domain. Its conflict predicate is a scheduling policy, not a
proof of concurrent hardware execution. Its atomic order, scope, and coherence
fields are retained labels; the proof performs no CPU or GPU atomic operation.
Its collective membership set is bounded to 256 positive participant
identities, but proves no wave convergence, LDS behavior, numerical reduction,
firmware progress, or cross-device communication.

`r9_native_evidence_v1.rs` proves fourteen abstract mapping, XGMI-route, and
machine-evidence obligations:

1. a canonical one-through-64-entry KFD GPU-ID sequence is positive, strictly
   ordered, and duplicate-free;
2. mapping begins with the exact canonical device array and zero map/unmap
   prefixes;
3. a failed MAP outcome retains exactly the absolute cumulative successful
   prefix reported for the full KFD GPU-ID roster;
4. an admitted partial successful-compensation transition retains the absolute
   cumulative prefix and remains unreleasable;
5. the abstract successful-compensation transition releases only after its
   absolute cumulative prefix equals the exact mapped prefix;
6. an admitted XGMI route retains its exact source/destination device and
   generation, topology generation, hive, directional IO-link type/index,
   bandwidth, engine mask, selected engine, and reset-currentness coordinates;
7. reversing the source and destination cannot satisfy directional route
   currentness;
8. a stale topology generation blocks XGMI route admission;
9. matching machine evidence retains the exact artifact, gfx942 COV6 target,
   symbol, descriptor, machine-code digest, checked instruction-class receipt,
   declared semantic-contract identity, and kernel identity;
10. substituting the checked instruction-class receipt rejects the evidence
    binding;
11. any stale device, code, mapping, queue, or reset-fence coordinate blocks
    dispatch; and
12. an evidence-bound dispatch publishes only when every exact binding is
    current and its dependency frontier is complete;
13. a native XGMI copy publishes only with two fully active mapping owners, an
    exact current directional route and selected engine, and distinct
    nonoverlapping source/destination ranges; and
14. timeout or indeterminate XGMI completion quarantines the copy and retains
    both exact mapping owners.

The selected native route is one retained directional KFD `io_links` record.
KFD `p2p_links` records remain part of the topology snapshot but are not a
selected coordinate of the current `Gfx942XgmiRouteV1`, so the R9 route model
does not invent a P2P-link ID. The executable model additionally checks that
the recommended engine mask contains exactly one bit and that its index is the
selected gfx942 XGMI SDMA engine. The Verus model retains the exact mask and
engine coordinates but does not prove bit-level mask decoding.

## R9 claim matrix

| Surface | Status | Exact boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abstract canonical mapping, successful compensation, route/copy currentness and custody, evidence equality, and dispatch gating | **Proved** | The fourteen theorems in `r9_native_evidence_v1.rs`; mathematical values only. The compensation theorem has no ioctl result-status input and does not prove errno-at-full-prefix handling. |
| Executable `r9_native_evidence.rs` state machines and rejection tests | **Checked** | Rust tests cover absolute cumulative prefixes, including a retry after prior progress, failed-full-prefix quarantine, canonical arrays, directional topology, exact evidence equality, and stale dispatch rejection. There is no Rust-to-Verus refinement theorem. |
| Instruction-class receipt | **Checked** | The model binds the digest of a separately checked decoder/classifier receipt. It does not prove decoded instructions implement the declared atomic or collective semantics. |
| KFD topology, `n_success`, VM mapping ownership, queue selection, reset observations, firmware, and coherence | **Contracted** | A native adapter must authenticate observations, preserve owners, and fail closed on uncertain side effects. |
| Compiler preservation and machine-code semantics | **Not established** | Artifact and receipt identities are bound exactly, but no theorem relates Rust/device-language semantics through LLVM to decoded gfx942 instructions. This is not machine-semantic refinement. |
| Native XGMI transfer, atomic/collective results, progress, and performance | **Measured** | Exact-commit hardware qualification is evidence for the tested machine only; it is not a proof. |

The native-copy theorem is not a refinement of the concrete SDMA queue state
machine. In particular, a concrete batch reobserves full directional topology
at its scope edges and checks both process/reset fences per operation, but does
not rediscover sysfs topology for every packet. A concrete wait timeout may
retain its exact ticket for retry instead of entering the abstract
`Quarantined` phase, while a completion followed by failed currentness retains
both mappings in a distinct completed-but-indeterminate result. The common
proved safety property is custody: neither an uncertain abstract completion
nor these concrete failure results authorize early mapping release. Per-packet
topology currentness, the concrete ticket/record correspondence, and those
concrete phase distinctions require a future Rust-to-Verus refinement.

`r10_closed_execution_v1.rs` proves twenty abstract closed-composition
obligations:

1. an incomplete dependency, including one produced on another stream, blocks
   publication;
2. a ready operation publishes with its exact stream, execution device, kind,
   dependencies, leases, batch identity, and publication epoch;
3. two distinct operations with disjoint lease sets can remain published
   simultaneously;
4. an unready prepared batch has no partial-publication transition;
5. a ready batch publishes its complete exact roster at one batch identity and
   publication epoch;
6. completed pool-block release preserves storage identity, advances its
   generation, and only then returns it to the free phase;
7. a stale lease cannot equal a later generation of the same pool block;
8. a peer copy has two distinct device owners and executes on its destination
   device coordinate;
9. post-publication cancellation and timeout retain the exact lease set and
   published phase;
10. indeterminate failure quarantines the operation, retains its leases, and
    does not make it releasable;
11. corresponding atomic load, store, and RMW records separately retain the
    declared operation, order, scope, required fence plan, and abstract value
    relation;
12. a substituted observed atomic scope cannot satisfy correspondence;
13. a divergent or incomplete Wave64 arrival cannot publish; and
14. converged Wave64 barrier, reduction, inclusive-scan, and exclusive-scan
    records publish the exact mathematical input, total, or prefix sequence.

The numbering above groups related theorems; the verifier reports twenty proof
obligations. The executable `closed_execution.rs` model is bounded to 64
streams, 64 pools, 4,096 blocks, 4,096 operations, 64 leases per operation, and
256 dependencies per operation. Its Rust tests check simultaneous compute
operations, cross-stream dependency gating, failure-atomic prepared batches,
generation-safe allocation reuse, exact two-device peer-copy custody,
cancellation/timeout/quarantine retention, atomic label/fence/value rejection,
and Wave64 wrapping reduction/scan results.

| Surface | Status | Exact boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abstract closed operation, batch, pool, peer-owner, atomic-record, and Wave64 relations | **Proved** | Twenty theorems in `r10_closed_execution_v1.rs`; finite mathematical values only. |
| Executable `closed_execution.rs` transitions and negative tests | **Checked** | Rust unit tests exercise the bounded state machine and executable wrapping arithmetic. |
| Executable Rust to Verus correspondence | **Not established** | The Rust and Verus models intentionally use parallel structures, but there is no refinement theorem connecting their implementations. |
| Atomic instruction decoding and compiler preservation | **Not established** | Atomic observed-operation/order/scope/fence fields are caller-supplied abstract observations, not decoded-instruction or compiler certificates. |
| Wave convergence, barrier behavior, LDS, and machine arithmetic | **Contracted** | The model checks exact 64-lane arrival and computes host-side results; it does not establish GPU control-flow convergence or ISA behavior. |
| KFD/HSA/HIP queues, mappings, coherence, completion, progress, and performance | **Contracted or measured** | Native adapters and hardware qualification must bind real resources and observations to the model. No model value grants native authority. |

`r11_runtime_semantics_v1.rs` proves eighteen abstract facade-semantics
obligations:

1. a recorded event aliases its pending source submission;
2. a conclusive observation becomes the shared event/submission status;
3. first completion discharges every registered callback with the exact status;
4. a repeated observation cannot discharge callbacks again;
5. a live event prevents source-submission release;
6. an exact atomic operation/scope/order/geometry contract with both capability
   layers is admitted, including a base-valid partial grid;
7. legal compare-exchange success/failure order and weak-mode contracts are
   admitted;
8. an illegal compare-exchange failure order is rejected;
9. compare-exchange-only failure-order or weak controls reject on non-CAS
   operations;
10. any substituted atomic contract field is rejected;
11. a missing execution-detail atomic capability fails closed;
12. a workgroup collective admits its exact geometry-derived membership;
13. a collective membership mismatch is rejected;
14. a collective grid with a partial tail workgroup is rejected;
15. a single-stream system collective is rejected;
16. an active persistent mapping is retained by its exact batch;
17. conclusive batch completion restores the same persistent mapping identity;
    and
18. indeterminate completion quarantines the mapping and blocks release.

The executable `r11_runtime_semantics.rs` model additionally checks bounded
event/source lookup, terminal callback registration, event-gated release,
capability rejection, collective geometry validation, repeated persistent-map
reuse, atomic partial-grid admission, the complete compare-exchange order
lattice in weak and strong modes, non-CAS control rejection, and all-mapping
quarantine. Complete workgroups are a collective-only requirement. It performs
no callback, backend call, mapping syscall, atomic operation, collective, or
device execution.

## R11 claim matrix

| Surface | Status | Exact boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abstract shared completion, callback discharge, launch admission, and persistent-map custody | **Proved** | Eighteen theorems in `r11_runtime_semantics_v1.rs`; mathematical values only. Atomic admission includes compare-exchange failure-order and weak-mode legality. Collective geometry requires every grid dimension to contain at least one workgroup and divide exactly by its workgroup dimension. |
| Executable bounded R11 model | **Checked** | Rust unit tests exercise independently implemented model transitions and rejection cases. |
| Executable Rust to Verus correspondence | **Not established** | No theorem connects `src/r11_runtime_semantics.rs` or the runtime facade to the Verus structures. |
| Native atomic, collective, callback, event, and persistent mapping behavior | **Not established** | Concrete adapters must authenticate capability and completion observations and retain native custody. |
| Compiler, ISA, hardware progress, and performance | **Not established** | No R11 model value is execution authority or hardware evidence. |

`r12_native_concurrency_v1.rs` proves twenty-three abstract multi-queue custody
obligations:

1. only an exact, stable device capability supporting at least two requested
   compute queues admits the requested queue and slot counts;
2. single-queue, unstable, and over-capacity requests are rejected;
3. queue occurrences and slot generations must match exactly;
4. an unready dependency prevents publication, while every dependency identity
   must resolve in the modeled submission sequence to a successful terminal
   producer before publication;
5. a ready consumer publishes without releasing slot or resource custody, and
   a failed or otherwise non-successful producer leaves it reserved;
6. an exact terminal observation retains custody until explicit release;
7. an event for another slot or queue cannot complete a submission, while
   terminal events for distinct slots may be observed out of order;
8. cancellation before publication relinquishes custody, advances the live
   slot generation exactly once, and permits drain;
9. cancellation or release after publication does not relinquish custody;
10. a reserved dependent found by scanning the modeled submission sequence
    blocks producer release; otherwise terminal release relinquishes custody,
    advances the live slot generation, and permits drain;
11. currentness loss cancels reserved work with the same generation advance but
    converts published work to resource-retaining quarantine;
12. indeterminate custody cannot be released or drained;
13. drain is bound to the exact queue occurrence; and
14. recreating a drained current queue preserves its numeric queue ID while
    advancing its occurrence exactly once.

The numbering groups related theorems; the verifier reports twenty-three proof
obligations. The executable `r12_native_concurrency.rs` model is bounded to 16
queue occurrences, 64 slots per queue, 4,096 submissions, 256 dependencies per
submission, 64 resources per submission, and 8,192 registered resources. Its
Rust tests cover exact capability binding, out-of-order completion, cross-queue
and stale-generation rejection, dependency gating, failed dependencies,
prepublication cancellation, post-publication retention, currentness-loss
quarantine, occurrence-bound drain, and drained-queue occurrence advance.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Abstract multi-queue admission, dependency, terminal-event, cancellation, release, currentness, drain, and queue-recreation relations | **Proved** | Twenty-three theorems in `r12_native_concurrency_v1.rs`; finite mathematical state only. Dependency readiness and reserved-dependent retention are derived by scanning abstract submission sequences and matching submission identities. |
| Executable bounded R12 model | **Checked** | Rust unit tests exercise an independently implemented finite state machine with exact occurrence and generation identities. |
| Executable Rust to Verus correspondence | **Not established** | No theorem connects `src/r12_native_concurrency.rs` to the Verus structures or transitions. |
| Native KFD multi-queue creation, scheduling, completion, reset, and quiescence | **Not established** | A native adapter must authenticate capabilities, queue occurrences, resources, terminal observations, and currentness. Model values grant no native authority. |
| HSA/HIP parity, progress, fairness, overlap, and performance | **Not established** | These are implementation and matched-hardware measurement obligations, not consequences of the R12 model. |

`r13_logical_scheduler_v1.rs` proves twenty abstract logical-stream scheduler
obligations:

1. a valid scheduler state contains between one and 64 distinct per-stream
   head/tail records while exposing exactly two physical lanes, and three or
   more represented logical streams therefore exceed the physical-lane count;
2. valid submission dependency count and depth remain bounded at 32, and a
   represented stream predecessor is included in the effective dependency set;
3. only the head of the exact registered logical-stream record may publish,
   including when compute and copy operation classes alternate in one FIFO;
4. an incomplete dependency frontier or any overlap with the aggregate
   retained resources of active lanes blocks publication;
5. a ready head deterministically leases one free lane numbered zero or one,
   takes resource custody, and preserves distinct lane owners;
6. a terminal observation must name the submission's exact leased lane and that
   lane must still name the submission as owner; the transition returns that
   lane and retains resources until release;
7. cancellation applies only to an unpublished tail and restores its exact
   predecessor as the prior tail; non-tail and published cancellation are
   no-ops;
8. a queued dependent, including a represented implicit stream successor,
   retains its terminal producer's resources, while an unreferenced terminal
   may release them; and
9. currentness loss cancels queued work and converts published or terminal
   custody into unreleasable quarantine, retaining the submission's recorded
   lane coordinate.

The numbering groups related theorems; Verus reports twenty proof
obligations. The independent executable `r13_logical_scheduler.rs` model is
bounded to 64 logical streams, exactly two lanes, 4,096 submissions, 32
dependencies and dependency depth per submission, 64 resources per submission,
and 8,192 registered resources. Its effective dependency set includes the
implicit same-stream predecessor, so predecessor failure, terminal custody, and
depth accounting use the same bounded edge as explicit dependencies. Active
resource conflict ownership is separate from lifetime retention: an ordered
successor can take active ownership after terminal producer observation while
older terminal submissions retain the resource identity. Lifetime retainers do
not act as active-conflict owners, and releasing one retainer does not discard
the others. Its Rust tests exercise more logical streams than lanes,
mixed compute/copy FIFO order, successful, failed, and implicit dependencies,
dependency bounds, ordered same-resource progress, active and terminal resource
conflicts, lane-bound terminal events, tail restoration, dependent release
retention, device-bound identities, and currentness quarantine.

Run the proofs and all expected-negative mutations with the exact Verus
release whose executable, complete release closure, version, proof sources,
source checker, transcript, and mutations are pinned under `verus/pins`:

```sh
VERUS=/absolute/path/to/verus \
  crates/fe2o3-runtime-model/verus/verify-verus.sh
```

`scripts/ci-local.sh verus` invokes the same authenticated runner. The
`runtime-model-verus.yml` pull-request workflow downloads the named release and
then relies on this runner's executable and complete-closure pins before any
proof result is accepted.

The mutations must fail at their named postconditions: release while retained,
VM generation substitution, stale generation reuse, topology/render PCI
substitution, dropped DRM schema identity, lost history predecessor, mixed
cross-source identity, a dropped final reset-fence observation, allocation free
while a partial mapping remains, cumulative unmap progress incorrectly added to
prior progress, a failed full-prefix unmap treated as releasable, a queue

Worker V4 downgrade acceptance, an over-bound dependency count, semantic
variant mismatch, custody on malformed admission, semantic-contract
substitution, terminal reopening, collapsed worker/sidecar scope predicates,
and sidecar contract substitution.
R18 mutations additionally reject duplicate native authority, allocation-VM,
logical-queue, native-SDMA-queue, native-child-occurrence, attachment-generation,
host-generation, persistent-range, completion
range, completion-ticket, and completion-native substitutions; reversed D2H
engine or endpoint polarity; incomplete prepublication restoration; confirmed
publication from a stale ticket; retained ambiguity without quarantine; timeout
without ticket/native custody; native release while published; stale frontier
retirement; release with a retained settled frontier; and exhaustion after 65
sequential settle/retire cycles. The launcher
rejects source substitution, lexically audits all proof files for trusted
constructs, clears the environment, bounds execution time, pins Z3 through the
authenticated Verus release closure, and rechecks the authenticated inputs after
verification.

`r14_async_observer_v1.rs` proves ten abstract obligations for the bounded
event-observation layer: the waiter bound is 65,536; invalid, duplicate, and
over-capacity registration leave the waiter count unchanged; a pending
observation preserves the exact registration; terminal status and runtime error
outcomes are not substituted; abandonment and engine stop preserve submission
and event custody without cancellation or release; and event-key ordering is
lexicographic in context generation and event identity. Eight expected-negative
mutations demonstrate rejection when those properties are reversed. The
independent executable `src/r14_async_observer.rs` model additionally tests
stable ordering, out-of-order completion, immediate terminal registration, and
shutdown outcomes.

The R14 proof does not refine `src/r14_async_observer.rs` or the production Rust
async engine. It proves no property of threads, channels, locks, wakers, backend
polling, progress, fairness, latency, KFD, HSA, HIP, or hardware. In particular,
observation neither publishes deferred work nor provides asynchronous device
execution by itself; the runtime's declared progress operation remains a
separate obligation.

`r16_worker_semantic_boundary_v1.rs` verifies twenty-one abstract obligations for an
already-decoded Worker V5 semantic request and direct-KFD sidecar boundary:

1. only the exact V5 handshake opens the ready state;
2. every non-V5 handshake seals without attempting or accepting custody;
3. the exact atomic `63 + K + 29B + 8D` and collective
   `69 + K + 29B + 8D` frame formulas fit the 65 MiB frame cap when `K` is at
   most 1 MiB, `B` is at most 128, and `D` is at most 256;
4. every modeled geometry component has the production `u32` bound, workgroup
   multiplication has the `u32` bound, and collective participant products have
   the production `u64` bound;
5. composed binding/dependency admission is explicitly narrower than Worker
   wire validation and does not assign those checks to the codec;
6. malformed composed admission seals without increasing attempted or accepted
   custody;
7. a valid request starts one exact in-flight attempt without yet counting an
   accepted custody;
8. worker-wire and direct-KFD sidecar contract validity are distinct: the
   worker boundary permits System atomics and Device collectives, rejects
   System collectives, while the direct sidecar permits only non-System atomics
   and Workgroup collectives;
9. recoverable rejection and quiescence restore ready state without accepting
   custody or fabricating a success;
10. only a nonzero success accepts custody, exactly once, and preserves the
   in-flight contract and launch;
11. zero-handle success, terminal response, malformed response, timeout, and
    EOF seal with the request explicitly indeterminate and without fabricating
    accepted custody;
12. terminal state is absorbing for requests and responses;
13. the initial state satisfies a well-shaped reachable-state invariant;
14. negotiation preserves that invariant;
15. composed request admission preserves that invariant;
16. response classification preserves that invariant;
17. the handshake/request/nonzero-success composition preserves the exact
    contract, launch, counts, and invariant;
18. sidecar summaries use the exact V1 schema/version, nonzero encoded length
    bounded to 16 MiB, at most 16,384 records, exact typed/ordinary counts, and
    complete-history equality with the source runtime profile;
19. an exact sidecar sequence is an ordered, unique, per-index bijection between
    retained dispatch publications, producer observations, and records; and
20. any per-index substituted sidecar record fails that sequence join.

The recursive typed-record count contributes the twenty-first verified obligation
reported by Verus.

Ten R16 expected-negative mutations reject handshake downgrade, dependency and
pre-custody bound weakening, exact-contract or sidecar substitution, collapsed
Worker/direct-sidecar scope predicates, terminal reopening, variant mismatch,
recoverable-response custody fabrication, and unreachable terminal in-flight
state.

The independent `no_std` executable model in
`src/r16_worker_semantic_boundary.rs` has nine unit tests over the same abstract
surface. It checks concrete model vectors for binding-patch alignment, bounds,
zero placeholders, disjointness, nonempty checked regions, and unique
dependencies. In the Verus file those facts are supplied as decoded-summary
booleans; no theorem connects them to a byte parser.

R16 request admission is intentionally a composed pre-custody abstraction. It
does not assign each check to the production worker parser, dispatcher, or
backend/facade call site. Attempted requests and in-flight/indeterminate custody
are separate from accepted custody, which advances only after an abstract
nonzero-success response; none is a concrete backend-invocation counter. The
sidecar theorem covers ordered modeled fields but deliberately omits the
SHA-derived record and content identities. Neither the Verus specification nor
the executable
model refines production Rust, a parser or codec, serde/JSON, SHA-256 or content
identity, subprocess creation and teardown, channels, transport, authentication,
timeouts, kill/reap behavior, compiler or ISA lowering, KFD/native execution,
GPU atomics or collectives, hardware completion, liveness, or performance. The
handshake values are abstract labels, not a proof of wire-byte compatibility.

## R17 persistent native allocation

`r17_persistent_native_allocation_v1.rs` proves 32 obligations over one
abstract owner. Admission binds a nonzero, page-sized allocation of at most 256
MiB to exact R2-shaped allocation/mapping identities, an exact canonical pair
of device incarnations, and a private registry incarnation. The model fixes a
reusable 64-slot use ledger and 256-dependency input bound. Slot reuse advances
generation. A private registry incarnation rejects state-changing tokens and
dependency witnesses from reconstructed registries; numeric observation keys
and receipts remain non-authoritative and may coincide across reconstructions.

Compute and local-SDMA descriptors bind the allocation's exact home device and
VM plus a nonzero queue occurrence; local SDMA also binds one of two engines.
XGMI route-metadata classifications validate an R9-shaped current directional
route, the selected engine from the `[2,16)` R9 roster, both device identities,
and owner-relative source-read or destination-write access. They do not bind
the route to this R2 mapping and grant no mapping or publication authority.
Half-open ranges are nonempty, nonoverflowing, and within the admitted
allocation extent. Overlapping reads are compatible; overlap with a writer is
excluded unless an exact successful terminal predecessor is named as a ready
dependency. Unrelated terminal conflicts still block publication. Timeout and
exact terminal observations retain custody, reserved dependents block terminal
release, currentness loss cancels unpublished work and quarantines every
published state, and quarantined owners cannot release. A concrete mixed
compute/local-SDMA/XGMI-metadata witness prevents the class predicates from
being vacuous.

The independent executable model has 19 focused Rust unit tests plus
compile-fail examples for `Clone` and `Send`. Its private `Rc` incarnation is a
Rust type-system device, not a Verus refinement. Verus cannot prove Rust
auto-traits, OS-thread affinity, native allocation/mapping, queue publication,
KFD or SDMA behavior, currentness observation truth, GPU completion, liveness,
or performance. There is no executable-Rust-to-Verus correspondence theorem,
no two-registry atomic XGMI join, and no 1 GiB aggregate allocation claim.

## R18 persistent local SDMA adapter

`r18_persistent_local_sdma_adapter_v1.rs` proves 34 obligations over one
abstract persistent local device allocation, one ordinary host allocation, and
one targeted gfx942 SDMA operation. The binding retains the allocation, mapping,
VM and device generations; host session, allocation, generation, and coherent
visibility; persistent and host half-open ranges; copy extent; persistent-use
identity; logical parent queue occurrence; native KFD queue slot; engine; and
planned ticket slot and generation. The logical queue ID and native KFD queue
ID are separate fields.
Native KFD queue slot zero is admitted, while values at or above 1024 are
rejected.

The direction roster is exact: device-to-host uses ordinary SDMA engine zero
and binds the persistent allocation as a read source; host-to-device uses engine
one and binds it as a write destination. The model deliberately admits one
in-flight adapter use because its sole abstract native authority changes
location between the prepared request, queue record, persistent owner, and
quarantine custody. Recoverable prepublication failure restores the exact
binding and prepared lease. Confirmed publication requires the planned ticket.
An SDMA retained error moves directly from prepared custody to quarantine: it is
not called published, because mapped completion or ring writes may have failed
before write-pointer publication. Pending and timeout observations retain the
same ticket and queue custody. Preparation currentness loss permanently
quarantines without claiming a ticket. Completion requires the exact ticket,
native and host identities, ranges, and extent; an incomplete currentness
envelope permanently quarantines the queue-retained ticket instead of leaving
published custody resumable. Completion settlement creates an exact retained
frontier keyed by the native allocation and persistent-use slot/generation;
release remains blocked until that frontier is retired by an exact observation.
Stale or substituted frontier observations are atomic no-ops, and the bounded
reuse proof shows that exact retirement leaves no occupied slot after 65
sequential uses. Normal release remains blocked until cancellation or retired
settlement and complete owner quiescence, and every quarantine is absorbing.

Twenty-four expected-negative mutations cover the listed identity, direction,
custody, ambiguity, completion, frontier-retirement, reuse, and release
boundary classes. These mutations are small countermodels to the named mathematical
properties; they do not inject faults into production Rust.

R18 is a standalone summary, not a refinement proof. It does not connect its
types or transitions to either R17 model, the concrete persistent-allocation
ledger, the separately implemented R18 adapter, or `sdma.rs`. In particular,
the concrete persistent operation enum itself carries no queue/engine receipt,
and R17's local-SDMA class does not distinguish child native SDMA queues that
share a logical parent queue; the concrete adapter's separate attachment record
has no refinement theorem to this file.
The abstract authority count does not prove unique Rust ownership, move/drop or
panic/unwind behavior, auto-traits, OS-thread affinity, address validity, ioctl
truth, queue-record installation, mapped-write or release-fence ordering,
doorbell delivery, currentness observations, firmware DMA, GPU completion,
memory visibility, liveness, or performance.

## R19 directional persistent local SDMA adapter

`r19_directional_persistent_local_sdma_adapter_v1.rs` proves 46 obligations
over one bounded allocation and one exact bidirectional child-queue pair. The
allocation binds a nonzero pool generation and distinct logical and physical
extents with `logical <= physical <= 256 MiB`; the physical extent is 4 KiB
page-rounded, while copy ranges are checked against the logical extent. Both
children share one logical parent queue and pair occurrence, have distinct
native queue IDs below 1024, and bind device-to-host to engine zero/read/source
and host-to-device to engine one/write/destination.

The adapter is single-flight across the pair. Direction is selected explicitly
for every submission and is not constrained by the prior direction: repeated
H2D/H2D, repeated D2H/D2H, and alternating sequences are all admitted. Exact
completion, restoration, settlement, and frontier retirement must finish
before the next submission. Retirement clears the R17 settled frontier; it
does not manufacture a post-retirement dependency token, and the next R17
reservation has no dependency. A recursive transition composes prepare,
publication, completion, restoration, settlement, and exact retirement before
the next recursive prepare. It derives 130 mixed-direction uses and 70 repeated
H2D uses with zero occupied slots and no pending frontier after retirement.

Confirmed, recoverable, and retained publication classifications remain
distinct. Pending and timeout retain the exact child ticket. The proof uses
bounded pair-global rotating ticket coordinates independent of the R17 use
generation; concrete child queues have independent planners and are outside
this proof. Succeeded and signed `i32` failed terminal statuses are exact
through restore and settlement. Preparation currentness ambiguity quarantines
without claiming a live ticket; ambiguity after possible native custody
quarantines with the exact ticket and clears the terminal status. Release,
rebind, and demotion require idle current custody and no pending frontier.
Demotion advances the pool generation; old frontiers cannot match a re-promoted
allocation. Exact frontiers bind the complete allocation and mapping identity,
parent and child pair, attachment, pool, direction, and adapter incarnation.
Executable Rust additionally binds transition tokens to a private `Rc`
incarnation.

The independent executable model has 23 focused Rust tests and compile-fail
examples for `Clone` and `Send`. Twenty pinned expected-negative mutations
cover child collision, physical extent, direction, repeated same-direction
admission, selected-child tickets, optional-ticket quarantine, timeout custody,
terminal status and restore currentness, early release, prepare-before-retire,
rebind/demotion busy gates, frontier allocation/pair/incarnation substitution
and actual recursive reuse, and isolated pool-generation ABA.

R19 is not a refinement proof of R17, R18, executable Rust, or KFD. The Verus
file proves mathematical summaries only; it does not establish Rust ownership,
native allocation or queue state, mapped-write ordering, doorbell delivery,
DMA/completion truth, liveness, HIP/HSA parity, or performance.

| Independent executable custody lifecycle | **Checked** | Twenty-three Rust tests plus compile-fail `Clone`/`Send`; it directly composes a private R17 registry but has no refinement theorem. |

| Executable-Rust, R17/R18, or native KFD refinement; hardware behavior or performance | **Not established** | Explicitly outside the R19 proof boundary. |

## R20 runtime-facade directional chunking

`r20_runtime_facade_directional_chunking_v1.rs` proves 31 obligations for a
single-allocation, single-flight facade over abstract R19 packet custody. H2D
and D2H bind exact host/device storage roles; H2H and D2D are unsupported and
their preflight is mutation-free. Exact dependency identity and status gate
publication. Pending dependencies retain `Ready`; failed dependencies settle a
retained conclusive failure, while dependency quiescence settles an exact
quiescent-without-result record.

Every successful chunk binds its byte offset to prior completed progress, caps
length at `0x003f_ffe0`, and carries an exact direction-selected ticket into an
R19-shaped frontier. Completion cannot expose the continuation until exact
frontier retirement. Poll is observational and never publishes a continuation;
only flush changes `Ready` to `Published`. Recursive actual-prior-state
transitions derive that 256 MiB requires 65 separately retired packets, with
exact destination-dirty progress, one final completion, and no remaining
ticket or frontier. Exact terminal release permits repeated same-direction or
mixed-direction admission.

A zero-progress retryable prepublication failure restores packet custody and
settles the accepted target as retained conclusive failure code `-1`. A retry after
partial progress restores packet custody and settles an exact, nonresumable
quiescent-without-result marker. Exact later poll observes either terminal by
submission identity; a foreign identity cannot observe or release it. Release
removes the target retainer. Opaque publication/currentness failure preserves
one authority in process-teardown custody. Cancellation is confined to an
unpublished `Ready` target with zero completed bytes.

The independent executable model directly composes the R19 executable adapter
and has 14 focused Rust tests. Fifteen pinned expected-negative mutations cover
direction/storage, offsets, ticket/frontier identity, poll publication, early
continuation, cancellation, dependency bypass, partial progress, terminal
quiescence and exact poll, opaque custody, frontier retirement, pool ABA,
currentness, and the 65-packet bound.

R20 is a standalone mathematical summary, not a correspondence theorem. It
does not prove that the executable Rust model implements the Verus transition,
or that runtime/KFD code implements either model. It proves no native syscall,
queue, DMA, completion, device-memory visibility, hardware liveness,
HIP/HSA parity, or performance claim.

## R20 claim matrix

| Direction/storage, dependency, packet offset, ticket/frontier, retirement, dirty/completion, retry, quiescence, target-retain, cancellation, currentness, and bounded recursive chunking relations | **Proved** | Thirty-one obligations in `r20_runtime_facade_directional_chunking_v1.rs`. |
| Independent executable facade over R19 lifecycle | **Checked** | Fourteen focused Rust tests; direct executable composition without a Verus correspondence theorem. |

## R21 runtime scripted failure seam

`r21_runtime_scripted_failure_seam_v1.rs` proves 37 obligations for an
independent abstract facade failure seam with exactly one native authority.
Promotion retry preserves exact host custody. Demotion retry before native
demotion preserves exact device custody; only a recovered owner after successful
demotion followed by recycle failure enters cleanup-only demoted-device custody.
Retryable hidden cleanup preserves that recovered authority, and teardown from
promotion, demotion, submission, polling, retirement, recycle, or hidden cleanup
moves the sole authority into opaque process-teardown custody.

Dependency-pending submission is separate from published polling and is
observation-only. An initial retryable submission becomes retained conclusive
failure code `-1`; the same classification after completed progress becomes an
exact quiescent-without-result record without erasing progress. In particular,
a completed D2H chunk records exact host-dirty progress, and a later retryable
submission preserves that host mutation and upgrades to quiescence. Published poll
pending, retry, and timeout preserve exact state and custody. Terminal metadata
mismatch and frontier/recycle mismatch fail closed. Exact completion must pass
through terminal custody, retirement, and slot recycle before a continuation or
terminal result is visible; successful recycle advances the exact slot
generation. Exact terminal release restores device-ready custody, foreign
release is atomic, and teardown blocks both submission and allocation release.

The executable R21 model has 17 focused Rust tests. It structurally owns one
private custody enum with no `Clone` or `Copy` implementation, reuses R20 request
and endpoint types and the R18 packet cap, and can derive its immutable binding
from an idle R19 snapshot. Fifteen pinned expected-negative mutations cover the
promotion, corrected demotion/recovered-cleanup distinction, initial/partial
submission, dependency pending, poll retry, timeout, completion metadata,
retirement, recycle, early continuation, hidden cleanup, and teardown release.

R21 is a standalone mathematical and executable test model. It does not prove a
correspondence with R20, concrete runtime/KFD code, a native failure injector,
or real failures. It proves no syscall, DMA/completion truth, device-memory
visibility, cleanup liveness, hardware behavior, HIP/HSA parity, or performance.

| Independent move-only executable failure model | **Checked** | Seventeen focused Rust tests; request-type reuse and snapshot binding without a Verus or concrete-runtime correspondence theorem. |

## R22 batched directional persistent SDMA windows

`r22_batched_directional_persistent_sdma_windows_v1.rs` proves 41 obligations
for an independent abstract directional window machine. A prepared window has
one through 63 packets, exact packet-count arithmetic, contiguous packet
offsets, exact full-window coverage, distinct modulo-64 slots, generations
derived by incrementing each selected slot's independent prior counter, the
selected directional child, and one aggregate lease. A wrapped witness advances
previously unused slot 63 from generation zero to one, reused slot zero from one
to two, and leaves unselected slot one unchanged.
Preparation has no publication effect. Confirmed publication commits the exact
packet count while incrementing the write-pointer and doorbell counters exactly
once each.

Retry before queue custody restores ready custody without consuming the
aggregate lease or changing publication counters. Once published, pending and
timeout observations preserve the whole window. A partial completion retains
published custody and cannot expose a continuation. Recovered publication
without an exact terminal result becomes quiescent and preserves the entire
possibly-mutated extent, including the host extent for D2H. Retained or
substituted publication/completion state becomes opaque process teardown while
retaining exactly one authority.

Exact terminal completion creates a frontier containing the complete window
roster. Continuation and directional dirty progress become visible only after
exact frontier retirement. The bounded 256 MiB witness requires two windows,
63 plus two packets, 65 packets total, and an exact final 2,048-byte packet.
Terminal release preserves reuse for repeated or opposite directions.

The executable R22 model has 18 focused Rust tests. It derives its immutable
binding from an idle R19 snapshot, but independently owns a private aggregate
custody enum with no `Clone` or `Copy` implementation. Public plans, completion
metadata, and frontiers are observations and do not carry authority. Nineteen
pinned expected-negative mutations cover the window bound, exact coverage,
contiguity, slot uniqueness, independent per-slot generation, ticket child,
preparation visibility, pointer and doorbell counts, prepublication restoration,
postpublication classification,
D2H host mutation, partial and timeout custody, completion identity, frontier
roster, early continuation, opaque custody, and the 256 MiB window count.

R22 is not a correspondence theorem for executable R19 or R22 Rust. Its
write-pointer and doorbell counters are mathematical transition fields, not
evidence of CPU atomics, ordering, coherence, firmware consumption, or DMA.
It proves no native KFD execution, hardware completion truth, liveness,
HIP/HSA parity, or performance.

The projection proof establishes the mathematical relation implemented by the
pure canonical-record mapping; it is not a proof that the executable Rust
implements that relation, nor that the adapter observed truthful kernel data.
The lifecycle, memory, and queue files prove abstract transition relations, not
refinement of `src/model.rs`, `src/device_identity.rs`,
`src/memory_lifecycle.rs`, `src/queue_lifecycle.rs`, or
`src/r12_native_concurrency.rs`, `src/r13_logical_scheduler.rs`, or
`src/r14_async_observer.rs`. All
receipts remain model-only and are not production device authority. A later
sealed adapter refinement must
authenticate the KFD topology, DRM render, partition, schema, and process XNACK
observations, bind the dynamically allocated KFD device node to the opened file
descriptor and sysfs device, and connect concrete ioctl/sysfs results to the
canonical record. `DeviceGenerationV1` is a software admission
incarnation for stale-token rejection; topology correlation does not detect or
attest a GPU reset. The reset booleans and wrapping VRAM-loss value are retained
contracted observations only; these proofs do not establish an all-reset
generation, ABA freedom, or correctness of the KFD event stream. Firmware
execution, hardware completion, progress, liveness, coherency, performance, and
absence of kernel/firmware defects remain outside this proof boundary. The R2
proofs do not establish executable-Rust refinement, VA reservation or native
allocation success, KFD `n_success` truth, syscall rollback, CPU/GPU coherence,
page-table state, or quiescence. An adapter must turn malformed or uncertain
side-effecting results into the model's unreleasable ambiguous state. The model
also does not prove that a copied R1 admission token is still active in a
separately evolved `DeviceIdentityStateV1`; that state-composition refinement is
required before a production adapter can consume the memory transitions.

The R4 model is bounded to sixteen queue incarnations, 256 append-only history
entries, and exactly four mapped resource roles. Per-role memory kind,
coherence, and access expectations are explicit plan inputs checked against the
R2 memory state; this proof does not assert that those policy choices are KFD,
gfx942, or ROCr hardware truths. The unchanged CREATE output sentinel and a
caller-labeled returned sentinel are both rejected, while zero is a valid
returned ID. Executable publications carry structural Generic versus exact
ComputeAqlQueue ownership; the generic public memory transition cannot release
the latter. CreatePending and unknown ambiguous CREATE results poison later
CREATE for the process lifetime of this model, and known ambiguous IDs remain
collision-retaining. No model value creates or owns a
native KFD queue. The proof does not establish executable-Rust
refinement, ioctl truth or atomicity, queue-ID ownership, target resource sizes,
doorbell mapping or arithmetic, executable AQL packet publication, completion,
quiescence, firmware execution, liveness, or performance. Those remain adapter,
target profile, dispatch, and hardware-refinement obligations.

The R7 resource proof uses mathematical identities, phases, natural numbers,
and finite sequences. The executable pool model separately exercises best-fit
reuse, generation advance, completion-gated release, quarantine retention, and
capacity rejection, but it is tested Rust rather than Verus-refined Rust. The
native gfx942 SDMA implementation additionally freezes the reviewed queue and
packet manifests and checks exact packet bytes. KFD ioctl truth, doorbell MMIO,
CPU/GPU coherence, firmware consumption, native multi-device isolation,
completion, progress, liveness, and performance remain contracted or measured,
not proved.

The R3 load-plan and materialization proofs establish only the stated
mathematical relations over already-formed abstract values. They do not prove
that `fe2o3-amdhsa-loader::plan` implements those relations or that its
untrusted ELF byte parser constructs the modeled records. Given a canonical
abstract plan and exact-length mathematical input sequence, the materialization
proof constructs the zero and three copy states rather than assuming a final
image relation. Those sequences and transitions are still mathematical values,
not evidence that executable Rust performed them. In particular, the proof does
not refine `ValidatedEnvelope`, `MaterializationPlan`, slice identity, a CPU or
GPU copy, allocation identity, or any syscall to the abstract operation. It does
not decode or verify metadata or symbols, execute relocations, authenticate
content, establish W^X transitions, or prove materialization on a GPU. Separate
executable parser/copy/syscall refinement and loaded-image proofs remain
required before any `loader_refined` authority claim. There is also no theorem
connecting the materialization plan to the separately proved load-plan profile,
so the materialization proof alone establishes neither 4 KiB alignment nor page
rounding.
