# Ferric project site

This directory deploys a dependency-free static GitHub Pages site. Project
status is kept in [`data/project.js`](data/project.js); curated, strictly
checked performance observations live in
[`data/performance.js`](data/performance.js). The harness pins Playwright for
real browser checks. Run all checks on the designated remote build host, not
locally, and remove the private stage after archiving evidence.

When implementation or qualification state changes:

1. Update `updated`, `readiness`, `validation`, `latestObservation`, and
   `recentProgress` in `data/project.js`.
2. Keep diagnostic, hardware-observed, and qualified claims distinct.
   Update performance values only from current, externally pinned correctness
   reports and ledgers. Keep n=1 ablations separate from repeated profiles,
   never pool request identities, exclude rejected numerical runs, and retain
   the exact controller/worker/artifact/ledger identities. The present queue
   contains five accepted n=1 profiles; both wave model profiles are rejected.
   Keep the later matched MFMA pair separate, including its startup regression.
   Serial-peer TP2/TP8 observations have no matched host controls. The CPU
   transpose-helper benchmark is not a model latency or throughput result.
3. Install the pinned browser harness and run both the structural and rendered
   checks:

   ```sh
   cd site
   npm ci
   npx playwright install chromium
   npm test
   FERRIC_EXHAUSTIVE_WIDTHS=1 npm test
   npm run stage -- /tmp/ferric-pages-artifact
   ```

The deployment workflow requires the exhaustive Chromium sweep in addition to
the syntax and structured-data checks before publishing. `validate.mjs` rejects schema
drift, stale current-dependency claims, unknown status states, malformed source
references, duplicate transitions, missing render targets, and missing local
assets. `render-validate.mjs` checks populated visible output without horizontal
overflow at the desktop, breakpoint-edge, and mobile widths; its exhaustive mode
checks every width from 320px through 1440px. `stage-artifact.mjs` creates and
validates the seven-file static deployment roster so `node_modules`, dependency
metadata, documentation, and test-only files cannot enter the Pages artifact.
`validate-performance.mjs` checks the closed performance schema and thirty-nine
negative mutations, including incorrect repetition counts, throughput windows,
runtime profiles, ledger identities, and cancelled-request TPOT. A Pages-only
publication must not include Ferric implementation, model files, or raw logs.
`validate-performance-evidence.mjs` additionally compares every new model metric,
request latency, binary/report pin and helper aggregate against externally
SHA-pinned local evidence inputs. Run it remotely with the measurement archive
and transpose archive paths, the previous public performance file and replica
archive path; these inputs are not part of the Pages artifact. Replica cohorts
use a distinct 64-output workload and common RAW release clock, not summed
instance rates or the earlier eight-output window. Publish the per-instance
row policy, actual loaded weight bytes and every request's separate admission
TTFT, release-to-first-token and seven-gap TPOT.
